Aile samma ko good file for error and stretch plots with comparison to multi bend: run1250311.py

subset wala good: run125031102.py

prediction aware directory banauda (compares pred aware directory with multibend): run1250402.py 

then, error plot hatayera stretch plot matra rakheko is run1250403.py

run1250404 bata chai sir lai pathako wala plots (pmultibend vs multibend). it also has a function that tries to plot box and whisker plot which doesn't work good as of now.

406 wala is good for the box and whisker plot with min avg and max

need to add error concept / err plot in this cluster implementation.

----khasai kaam lagena yo gareko-------
error = max of { 
                [ up hops q (in directory) + down hops q (in directory) + obj (shortest path from obj to actual requester q in G)] 
                    - 
                [ up hops p (in directory) + down hops p (in directory) + obj (shortest path from obj to predicted requester p in G)]
                } 

0407 wala ma cost difference plot gareko

0408 wala ma cost difference as prediction error normalized by diam ho.
------------------

409 has fixed prediction fraction, fixed num of nodes and varying err rate (err cutoff) on x axis
410 has fix pred frac fix err rate and varying n wala
